# Quotation System Prototype

This repository contains a minimal prototype of a quotation system built with the Next.js App Router. It provides placeholder components demonstrating how a quotation form might be structured using React, Tailwind CSS and Ant Design (not installed by default).

## Structure
- `app/` – Next.js app directory with the main page and layout
- `components/` – React components such as `QuotationHeaderForm`, `QuotationItemTable`, `SummarySection`, and `QuotationPreview`
- `styles/` – global Tailwind CSS file

The project does not include installed dependencies. To run locally you would need to install packages with `npm install` and then start the dev server with `npm run dev`.
